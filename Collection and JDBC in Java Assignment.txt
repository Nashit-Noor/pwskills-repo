1. What is the collection framework in Java?
Ans : Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of
objects.
-> Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on data such as searching, sorting, insertion,
manipulation, and deletion0
-> Collection means a single unit of objects.>
-> The Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector,
LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans : ArrayList : The ArrayList is similar to Arrays. They are also called dynamic arrays. That means it does not have a fixed
size. Its size can be increased or decreased if elements are added or removed
It implements the List Interface
Since the ArrayList cannot be used for primitive data types like int, char, etc. , we need to use a wrapper class.

LinkedList : The LinkedList class extends the AbstractSequentialList and it also extends the List, Deque and Queue
interface. By this, we get a linked-list data structure
Linked List is a linear data structure where the elements are called as nodes
Here, each node has two fields- data and next. Data stores the actual piece of information and next points
to the next node. 'Next' field is actually the address of the next node.
Elements are not stored in a contiguous memory, so direct access to that element is not possible
LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements while ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements.
LinkedList is faster in the manipulation of data as it is node-based which makes it unique.

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Ans : The main difference between Iterator and ListIterator in Java is that Iterator is a general-purpose interface for traversing
any collection in a forward direction, while ListIterator is specific to lists and allows for both forward and backward traversal,
as well as modification of the list during iteration. 

4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Ans : In Java, the key difference between an Iterator and an Enumeration is that Iterators allow modification of the collection
during traversal (via the remove() method), while Enumerations are designed for read-only traversal of legacy collections. 

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans : The primary difference between list and set is that a list allows duplicate elements and maintains their order,
while a set ensures element uniqueness without any guaranteed order. Since lists are ordered, position indexing is allowed in them.
However, in unordered items like sets, positional indexing is not possible.

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Ans : Hash set and tree set both belong to the collection framework. HashSet is the implementation of the Set interface whereas Tree set implements sorted set.
Tree set is backed by TreeMap while HashSet is backed by a hashmap.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hash Set							Tree Set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hash set is implemented using HashTable 			The tree set is implemented using a tree structure. 
HashSet allows a null object 					The tree set does not allow the null object. It throws the null pointer exception. 
Hash set use equals method to compare two objects		Tree set use compare method for comparing two objects. 
Hash set doesn't now allow a heterogeneous object 		Tree set allows a heterogeneous object 
HashSet does not maintain any order 				TreeSet maintains an object in sorted order 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans : Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements, while ArrayLists are dynamic and resizable collections of elements.
Arrays can only contain elements of a specific data type, while ArrayLists can hold elements of any data type.

8. What is JDBC in Java?
Ans : The JDBC API is a Java API that can access any kind of tabular data, especially data stored in a relational
database.
JDBC helps you to write Java applications that manage these three programming activities:
Connect to a data source, like a database
Send queries and update statements to the database
Retrieve and process the results received from the database in answer to your query
Here is the 7 step process to create a Java JDBC connection*
1.Import the packages
2.Register the drivers
3.Establish a connection
4.Create a statement
5.Execute the query
6.Retrieve results
7.Close the connections

9. What is DriverManager in JDBC?
Ans : DriverManager is a static class that manages the set of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers that are available for an application to use. 
Applications can use multiple JDBC drivers concurrently if necessary.

10. Which data types are used in storing the image and file in the database table?
Ans : To store images and files in a database table, we typically use BLOB (Binary Large Object) or VARBINARY data types.
